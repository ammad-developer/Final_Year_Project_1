# Final_Year_Project_1
A location tracking system using Face Recognition
#Project Description: This is a people tracking project based on face recognition. There will be different cameras in different parts of building. On main entrance, we will take some pictures of people, assign them some id, save record in database. Lets say there are some areas in building e.g area A, B, C. At each area there is a camera. After entering, if the person moves to any of these areas, the camera of that particular area recognizes the face, matches with the faces in database and updates the location of person.

#Problem it solves:
    1. Often Student wants to know in which area a particular teacher is at the moment to ask some questions.
    2. If I want to know the exact location of a doctor, it can be used in hospitals.
